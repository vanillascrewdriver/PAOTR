This is the first part of the research. It is a comparison of DFA and DynProg.
DFA is Depth First Algorithm, producing the ideal linear solution.
DynProg is a dynamic programming algorithm, producing the ideal tree solution (almost always better than linear).

Our goal is to see when DFA is reasonably good and when it fails. It only gives optimal solution for certain circumstances,
but we wish to see what other circumstances allow it to give near optimal.

To Do:
-Fix DynProg to make it the expected runtime. (D^2?)
